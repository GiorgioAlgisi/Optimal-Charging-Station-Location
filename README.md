# Optimal_charging_station_location
Project related to the exam of "Foundations of Operations Research" at POLIMI (Polytechnic university of Milan )

# Introduction

The rapid growth of e-bike ridership is proposing the problem of deploying a suitable charging infrastructure. The charging stations should be placed in strategic positions so as to guarantee a coverage of the whole cycle path. However, since the charging operations require a non negligible time, the charging station should be positioned in places where alternative activities could be carried out, as restaurants, museums, swimming pool, or other amenities. Moreover, the presence of a charging station could also induce e-cyclists to discover new places and generate positive externalities.

# Goal

Given a budget B, determine the subset of sites where to install the charging stations so that the total cost is not higher than B and the maximum distance between consecutive charging stations is minimized.
Consider that the cyclist has to visit all the touristic destination in a consecutive way.
